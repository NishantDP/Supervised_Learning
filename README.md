# Supervised_Learning
# Basic implementation of some of the supervised machine learning techniques in Python
## All the projects are from Udacity's Introduction to Machine Learning with TensorFlow Nanodegree Program.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

### 1. Linear Regression

In this section, the following methods/examples are implemented:

- Mini batch gradient descent.
- Basic linear regression for predicting life expectancy based on BMI.
- Polynomial regression.
- Regularization of Data.
- Feature scaling of Data.

### 2. Perceptron algorithm

In this section, a basic perceptron algorithm is implemented to separate data file data.txt.

### 3. Classification Tree

In this section, a Decision tree algorithm is implemented in sklearn for Titanic Survival Exploration.

### 4. Naive Bayes

In this section, Naive Bayes algorithm is implemented in sklearn for classifying Emails as spam or not spam.

### 5. Support vector machines

In this section, SVM model is implemented in sklearn for achieving a 100 percent classifying accuracy on a sample dataset.
Hyperparameters are tuned as required.

### 6. Ensemble methods

In this section, we will expand the spam classification example from Naive bayes by using ensemble classifiers like bagging, random forest and ada-boost.

### 7. Model Evaluation

In this section, we will implement the metrics used for evaluating the performance of the models.

- Classification model metrics:

	- Accuracy score
	- Recall score
	- Precision score
	- F1 and Fbeta scores
	- ROC curve and AUC
	
- Regression model metrics
	- Mean squared error
	- Mean absolute error
	- r2 score
