# Supervised_Learning
# Basic implementation of some of the supervised machine learning techniques in Python
### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

### 1. Linear Regression

In this section, the following methods/examples are implemented:

- Mini batch gradient descent.
- Basic linear regression for predicting life expectancy based on BMI.
- Polynomial regression.
- Regularization of Data.
- Feature scaling of Data.

### 2. Perceptron algorithm

In this section, a basic perceptron algorithm is implemented to separate data file data.txt.

### 3. Classification Tree

In this section, a Decision tree algorithm is implemented in sklearn for Titanic Survival Exploration.
