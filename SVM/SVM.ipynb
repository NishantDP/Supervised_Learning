    "### Support Vector Machines in sklearn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you'll use support vector machines to fit a given sample dataset with an accuracy of 100 percent by tuning the hyperparameters if required.\n",
    "For your support vector machine model, you'll be using scikit-learn's SVC class. This class provides the functions to define and fit the model to your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hyperparameters tuning\n",
    "When we define the model, we can specify the hyperparameters. As we've seen in this section, the most common ones are\n",
    "- C: The C parameter.\n",
    "- kernel: The kernel. The most common ones are 'linear', 'poly', and 'rbf'.\n",
    "- degree: If the kernel is polynomial, this is the maximum degree of the monomials in the kernel.\n",
    "- gamma : If the kernel is rbf, this is the gamma parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### You'll need to complete each of the following steps:\n",
    "1. Build a support vector machine model\n",
    "2. Fit the model to the data\n",
    "3. Predict using the model\n",
    "4. Calculate the accuracy of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This quiz requires you to find an accuracy of 100% on the training set. Of course, this screams overfitting! If you pick very large values for your parameters, you will fit the training set very well, but it may not be the best model. Try to find the smallest possible parameters that do the job, which has less chance of overfitting, although this part won't be graded."
